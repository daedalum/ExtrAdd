# What is "ExtrAdd"?
Do you want to take the dubbed audio from a video, for example, a movie or episode, in lower resolution and add it to a higher resolution video, but with the original audio? That's what ExtrAdd is for, a script that uses ffmpeg to automatically add new audio streams to video files.

# Requirements
To use it you must install `ffmpeg` — responsible for extracting and adding audio —, `tkinter` — which handles the user interface — and `python` (3.0+) — to be able to run the script.

# How does it work?
Open a terminal inside the folder of the script and run it with the command:
```
python script.py
```

First, select the file(s) you want to extract audio from. Then, select the file(s) you want to add the extracted audio to. Simple as that.
